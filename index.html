                    <p>I had a wonderful experience with the Piece of Cake Team. They were kind, incredibly efficient and followed the Covid protocols. I stored my stuff with them for 3 months as well and everything I stored came back just how it was before. I will definitely use Piece of Cake for my next move and would recommend them to anyone else who is looking to move in NYC!</p>

                    <p>I have used their moving service twice now and always been happy with the staff and service they provide. For the most recent service, I used both their moving and storage service. Overall had a great experience and they were way cheaper than other reliable movers. I have found cheaper storage services but reviews indicate that some boxes have gone missing. With a piece of cake you get your own storage unit so there is no issue.</p>

                    <p>Very professional and organized. I hired POC to move me out of my one bedroom in Harlem into a storage unit close by while I spend the next few months out of town. Two movers came and worked quickly and carefully (during a snow storm at that!). Prices were fair. I will use them again when it's time to return to NYC- highly recommended.</p>
